## Instalation

Sense is designed to work with Composer. 

If you are not acquainted with the use of [WPackagist](https://wpackagist.org/) with Composer for WordPress, we encourage the use of [our WordPress composer base installation](https://github.com/Simettric/wordpress-composer-installation).

That comes with best practices in order to maintain WordPress platforms using Composer and deploy your code to different environments.

## Adding Sense to your project

Once you have setup your WordPress project with composer, you need to edit composer.json file to specify that Sense is a requisity. For this, find the ``require`` block of code, and add ``"simettric/Sense"`` as in this example:

    "require": {
        "php": ">=5.4",
        "composer/installers": "1.*",
        "johnpbloch/wordpress": "4.*",
        "wpackagist-theme/twentysixteen": "*",
        "simettric/Sense" : "*"
    },
    
## Initialize and configure the Sense Kernel

Once you have installed WordPress, you ptionally can configure Sense paramaters, you need to do this **in your wp-config.php**

    //wp-config.php
    
    require_once dirname(__FILE__)."/../vendor/autoload.php";  
     
    \Simettric\Sense\Kernel::configure(array(
        "plugins_order" => array(
             "my_first_plugin", 
             "my_second_plugin", 
             "my_theme_plugin"
        )
    ));

At this time, Sense only have one global configuration parameter: the plugins_order parameter.
This parameter is used to customize the order in which your plugins and themes are registered in Sense.


## Sense Plugins

You can use Sense in your plugins and themes. Both can be registered as a Sense Plugin.

We will see how to register them in the next chapter.
